      Nicknamed “sea parrots” and sometimes “clowns of the sea“! Atlantic
      puffins have black and white feathers and a large parrot-like beak. They
      are small seabirds measuring around 25cm in length. Puffins spend most of
      their lives out at sea, resting on the waves when not swimming. Their
      range spans the eastern coast of Canada and the United States to the
      western coast of Europe. A puffin’s beak (or bill) changes colour during
      the year. In winter, the beak has a dull grey colour, but in spring it
      blooms with an outrageous orange! Puffins are flyers, flapping their wings up to 400 times a minute and speeding through
      the air at up to 88km an hour. Wow! 6. What’s more, these brilliant birds
      are great swimmers, too! Using their webbed feet as a rudder, puffins can
      dive down 60m under water in search of their favourite fish.
